			<h1>Habitat</h1>
			<p>The Snow Leopard, Panthera Uncia, which is its scientific name, is a large mountain cat. It has a powerful build that allows it to be able to climb steep, snowy slopes and its hind legs allow it to jump up to six times its own body length. It has a long tail that gives it balance and can wrap around the Snow Leopard for warmth. They prey on blue sheep, Argali wild sheep, ibex, marmots, pikas, and hare. They are typically found in China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afganistan, Russia, and Mongolia.</p>
			
			<h2>The Endangerment of the Snow Leopard</h2>
			<p>There are actually many causes for the endangerment of the Snow Leopard. Habitat loss, competition with livestock, and the decline of prey are very hard for the Snow Leopard to come back from. Another main reason for the decline in Snow Leopards is persecution and poaching. People poach these beautiful creatures for illegal wildlife trade. As an action to try to end the persecution of the Snow Leopard, the government has created laws that include imprisonment and fines, if you are found guilty in the poaching of this animal.</p>
